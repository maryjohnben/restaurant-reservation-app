# Restaurant Reservation Application

A project developed to assist restaurants with reservation and seating of customers. It can also keep track of table status and let the user make changes to the reservation in case needed. Once the customer is seated the data can be archived and later retrieved in the future as needed using the customer's phone number. 

### Some of the capabilities includes: 
- create and edit reservation
- cancel reservation
- create tables in the restaurant
- assign each table to customers based on party size
- free the table once customer is done
